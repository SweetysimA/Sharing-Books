# Sharing-Books
## Hello Sir

## Introduction:
In our modern technology, we are being addicted to the smart technologies, even when we want to read academics or story books, we use laptops, tabs, mobiles or etc. Sometimes it causes many health problems and also very tough to keep full attention while reading pdf files. If all the readers can share their books in such a platform where the other readers can get a chance to read those available books according to their choices, it will be very effective for them.
"Sharing-Books" among the readers is such kind of a software project which one gives us a great opportunity to gather knowledge without paying any cost.

## Applied SDLC Model:
The development process of an iterative model is divided into small, repeatable cycles or iterations and each iteration includes phases such as planning, designing, building, and testing. As this model allows us to go back to the initial phases and see how the changes were made, <strong>Iterative Model</strong> could be the most suitable Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model for the <strong>"Book-Sharing"</strong> project.

In an iterative model, the process starts with some of the software specifications and develops the first version of the software. After the first version, if there is a need to change the software, then a new version of the software is created with a new iteration. It will repeat until the deployment of the software.

Below are the steps involved in an iterative model for sharing books among readers-


## 1.	Identifying Requirements:
      •	Gather initial requirements for the book-sharing platform. This may involve discussions with stakeholders, potential users, and other relevant parties.
      •	Define the basic features and functionalities expected from the platform, such as user registration, book cataloging, search capabilities, user reviews, and sharing          options.
      
## 2.	Planning the Iterations:
      •	Break down the overall development into a series of smaller iterations. Each iteration should deliver a working and potentially deployable subset of the complete             book-sharing platform.
      •	Prioritize features and functionalities based on their importance and dependencies.

## 3.	Designing:
      •	Design the architecture and user interface for the identified features in the current iteration. This involves creating detailed design documents, wireframes, and            prototypes.
      •	Ensure that the design allows for future enhancements and integration with additional features.
      
## 4.	Implementation:
      •	Develop the features outlined in the current iteration's plan. This includes coding, testing, and integration of the features into the existing system.
      •	Follow coding standards and best practices to maintain code quality.

## 5.	Testing:
      •	Conduct thorough testing of the implemented features to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
      •	Perform both functional and non-functional testing to ensure the reliability, usability, and performance of the book-sharing platform.

## 6.	Review and Evaluation:
      •	Review the results of the current iteration with stakeholders, including potential users and project sponsors.
      •	Collect feedback on the implemented features and assess whether they meet the expectations and requirements.

## 7.	Feedback Incorporation:
      •	Based on the feedback received, make necessary adjustments and improvements to the features implemented in the current iteration.
      •	Iterate on the design and implementation, refining the solution based on user input.

## 8.	Deployment:
      •	Deploy the current iteration of the book-sharing platform, making the new features available to users.
      •	Ensure that deployment is seamless and that users can access and utilize the enhanced functionalities.

## 9.	Monitoring and Maintenance:
      •	Monitor the performance of the deployed features and address any issues that may arise post-deployment.
      •	Provide ongoing support and maintenance for the platform, addressing bugs, user feedback, and potential improvements.

## 10.	Iteration Repeats:
      •	Repeat the process for subsequent iterations, incorporating new features and improvements based on evolving requirements and user feedback.
      •	Continue the iterative cycle until the book-sharing platform meets the desired level of functionality and user satisfaction.

Throughout the iterative model, collaboration and communication with stakeholders are crucial. Regular feedback loops ensure that the development team remains responsive to changing requirements and user needs, leading to a more robust and user-friendly book-sharing platform over time.
