## Introduction:
In our modern technology, we are being addicted to the smart technologies, even when we want to read academics or story books, we use laptops, tabs, mobiles or etc. Sometimes it causes many health problems and also very tough to keep full attention while reading pdf files. If all the readers can share their books in such a platform where the other readers can get a chance to read those available books according to their choices, it will be very effective for them.

"Sharing-Books" among the readers is such kind of a software project which one gives us a great opportunity to gather knowledge without paying any cost.

## Applied SDLC Model:
The development process of an iterative model is divided into small, repeatable cycles or iterations and each iteration includes phases such as planning, designing, building, and testing. As this model allows us to go back to the initial phases and see how the changes were made, <strong>Iterative Model</strong> could be the most suitable Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model for the <strong>"Book-Sharing"</strong> project.

In an iterative model, the process starts with some of the software specifications and develops the first version of the software. After the first version, if there is a need to change the software, then a new version of the software is created with a new iteration. It will repeat until the deployment of the software.

## STEPS OF THE ITERATIVE MODEL

An iterative model of sharing books refers to a process where sharing and distributing books is done in a repetitive and incremental manner, with each iteration allowing for feedback and improvement. 

Here are the steps of an iterative model for sharing books among readers:

## 1. Identifying Requirements:

<strong>i.</strong> Gathering initial requirements which may involve discussions with stakeholders,potential users,and 
 other relevant parties.
     
<strong>ii.</strong> Identifying the basic features such as user registration,book cataloging,search capabilities,user 
 reviews, and sharing options.

## 2. Planning the iterations:
    
<strong>i.</strong> Breaking down the overall development into a series of smaller iterations.
<strong>ii.</strong> Priotizing features and functionalities for each iteration on their importance.

## 3.Designing: 
   <strong>i.</strong> Desinging the architecture and user interface for sharing books.

## 4.Implementation:
    Developing the functionalities outlined in the design phase.

## 5.Testing:
     various levels, including unit testing, integration testing, and system 
     testing.

## 6.Review and Evaluation:
     Review the implemented features within each iteration.
     Evaluate whether the functionality aligns with the initial requirements and 
     if any adjustments are needed.

## 7.Feedback Incorporation:

## 8.Deployment:

## 9.Monitoring and Maintenance:

## 10.Iteration Repeats:
